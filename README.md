Linux on the STM32F767IGT6-LQFP176 board with Buildroot
======================================================

The project is a set of patches and configuration files to build a bootloader and a Linux based system image with a minimal root file system for the great [STM32F767IGT6 board](https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32f767ig.html).

Board peripherals support
-------------------------

See this [overview of board peripherals support](doc/Board_peripherals_support.md).


Build
-----

Let's download, extract and patch Buildroot:

`$ make bootstrap`


Then build:

`$ make build`


After the build, the directory `stm32f767/ImageLinux` contains 
 - U-Boot images `u-boot-spl.bin` and `u-boot.bin`
 - compressed Linux kernel with linked RAM filesystem `zImage`
 - device tree blob `stm32f767-lqfp176.dtb`
